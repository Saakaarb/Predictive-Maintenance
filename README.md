# Predictive Maintenance Scheduling of Aircraft
Course Project- AA228/CS238, "Decision Making Under Uncertainity" by Prof. Mykel Kochenderfer, Stanford University
The project was done in collaboration with Ms. Eleanore Jacquemet, MS candidate Mechanical Engineering,Stanford University.

## Introduction

For an airline, aging aircraft fleets present a challenge in that
they need more maintenance, and are less efficient than newly
purchased aircraft. Ideally, when a carrier has a mixture of
older and newer aircraft at their disposal, they would always
want to fly the newer, more efficient versions. But contin-
uously flying the newer fleet is impossible, because regular
maintenance of these aircraft is required, which make them
unavailable for that time period. Combined with yearly trends
in passenger flying and stochastic fuel prices,optimal predic-
tive maintenance of more efficient aircraft is beneficial to the
airline, which wants to maximise revenue.
In this work, we frame the given problem as an MDP and
solve it using several algorithms, exploring the comparison of
average earned profits between an optimal maintenance pol-
icy and other policies like a greedy policy, which is more com-
monly used.

## Methodology

Using data from the past decade or so on several important metrics that affect 

## Files

- forward_search.py: File that reads real-world data from the file passengers.py and given certain parameters, calculates an optimal policy
- passengers.py: Uses data from several sources including the [Bureau of Transport](https://www.bts.dot.gov/product/passenger-travel-facts-and-figures) 
- Writeup.pdf: This is the final writeup for the course project, demonstrating results, drawbacks and future work. Refer to this for detailed explanations of every component of the project
